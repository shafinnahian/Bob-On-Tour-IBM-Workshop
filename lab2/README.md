## Step 1: Code Exploration with Ask Mode (10 minutes)

### Understanding the Vulnerable Codebase

The `vulnerable-app/` directory contains a todo application with intentional security issues. Let's use Bob's Ask mode to understand the code structure.

### 1.1: Switch to Ask Mode

Open Bob and switch to **Ask Mode** (❓).

### 1.2: Explore the Backend

**Prompt for Bob:**

```
Please analyze the code in lab2/vulnerable-app/backend/ and explain:
1. What is the overall structure of the application?
2. How are database queries constructed?
3. How is user input handled?
4. What security measures are in place?
```

**What to Look For:**

Bob should identify:
- Flask application with REST API endpoints
- Direct string concatenation in SQL queries ⚠️
- Hardcoded database credentials ⚠️
- Missing input validation ⚠️

### 1.3: Explore the Frontend

**Prompt for Bob:**

```
Analyze the frontend code in lab2/vulnerable-app/frontend/ and explain:
1. How is user input displayed in the UI?
2. Are there any DOM manipulation methods that could be risky?
3. How is data from the API rendered?
```

**What to Look For:**

Bob should identify:
- Use of `innerHTML` for rendering user content ⚠️
- No input sanitization ⚠️
- Direct insertion of user data into DOM ⚠️

### 1.4: Ask About Specific Functions

**Prompt for Bob:**

```
Explain the search_todos() function in app.py. 
What does it do and are there any security concerns?
```

**Expected Response:**

Bob should explain that the function uses string formatting to build SQL queries, which is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**💡 Key Learning**: Ask mode is perfect for understanding unfamiliar code and getting explanations of how things work.

---

## Step 2: Bug Identification with Plan Mode (10 minutes)

Now let's use Architect mode to systematically identify all the issues.

### 2.1: Switch to Plan Mode

Change from Ask to **Plan Mode** (🎯).

### 2.2: Request Security Analysis

> **💡 Using Bob Findings**
> Bob Findings can automatically scan your code for security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and compliance violations. The analysis you're about to request demonstrates Bob's [Security Vulnerability Detection](../bob-differentiators.md#security-vulnerability-detection) capabilities, which go beyond basic static analysis to provide context-aware recommendations.

**Prompt for Bob:**

```
Analyze the codebase in lab2/vulnerable-app/ for security vulnerabilities.
Create a comprehensive report including:
1. List of all security issues found
2. Severity rating for each issue (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
3. Potential impact of each vulnerability
4. Recommended fix for each issue
5. Priority order for fixes
```

**Expected Output:**

Bob should provide a structured analysis like:

```
SECURITY ANALYSIS REPORT
========================

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Hardcoded Database Credentials (config.py)
   - Impact: Full database access if code is exposed
   - Fix: Use environment variables
   - Priority: 1

2. SQL Injection (app.py, search_todos function)
   - Impact: Unauthorized data access, data manipulation
   - Fix: Use parameterized queries
   - Priority: 1

HIGH ISSUES:
3. Cross-Site Scripting (app.js, displayTodo function)
   - Impact: Script injection, session hijacking
   - Fix: Use textContent instead of innerHTML
   - Priority: 2

MEDIUM ISSUES:
4. Missing Input Validation
   - Impact: Invalid data in database
   - Fix: Add validation middleware
   - Priority: 3
```

### 2.3: Create Fix Plan

**Prompt for Bob:**

```
Based on the security analysis, create a detailed plan for fixing these issues.
Include:
1. Order of fixes (most critical first)
2. Files that need to be modified
3. Specific code changes required
4. Testing strategy
```

**Bob's Response:**

Bob will create a detailed TODO list with all the fixes needed. This demonstrates Bob's ability to break down complex problems into actionable steps.

**⚠️ Important**: Review the TODO list Bob creates, but **do not implement the fixes yet**. We'll examine each vulnerability type in detail in the next step before making any changes. This ensures you understand what you're fixing and why.

**💡 Key Learning**: Plan mode excels at analysis, planning, and creating structured approaches to problems. The TODO list serves as your roadmap for the implementation phase.

## Step 3: Security Vulnerability Deep Dive (15 minutes) - Optional

This step provides a detailed explanation of each vulnerability type. If you're already familiar with these security concepts, you can skip to [Step 4: Implementing Fixes](#step-4-implementing-fixes-10-minutes).

**What you'll learn in this deep dive:**
- How SQL injection attacks work
- How XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited
- Why hardcoded secrets are dangerous
- Best practices for secure coding

Let's examine each vulnerability type in detail.

### 3.1: SQL Injection Vulnerability

**Location**: `vulnerable-app/backend/app.py`

**Vulnerable Code:**
```python
@app.route('/api/todos/search', methods=['GET'])
def search_todos():
    query = request.args.get('q')
    # VULNERABLE: Direct string formatting in SQL
    sql = f"SELECT * FROM todos WHERE title LIKE '%{query}%'"
    results = db.session.execute(sql)
    return jsonify([dict(row) for row in results])
```

**The Problem:**

An attacker could send a malicious query like:
```
?q='; DROP TABLE todos; --
```

This would result in:
```sql
SELECT * FROM todos WHERE title LIKE '%'; DROP TABLE todos; --%'
```

**Prompt for Bob (Ask Mode):**

```
Explain how the SQL injection vulnerability in search_todos() works.
Provide an example of a malicious query and what damage it could cause.
```

**The Fix:**

Use parameterized queries:
```python
@app.route('/api/todos/search', methods=['GET'])
def search_todos():
    query = request.args.get('q')
    # SECURE: Parameterized query
    results = Todo.query.filter(Todo.title.like(f'%{query}%')).all()
    return jsonify([todo.to_dict() for todo in results])
```

### 3.2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability

**Location**: `vulnerable-app/frontend/app.js`

**Vulnerable Code:**
```javascript
function displayTodo(todo) {
    const todoElement = document.createElement('div');
    // VULNERABLE: innerHTML with user content
    todoElement.innerHTML = `
        <h3>${todo.title}</h3>
        <p>${todo.description}</p>
    `;
    document.getElementById('todo-list').appendChild(todoElement);
}
```

**The Problem:**

An attacker could create a todo with title:
```html
<img src=x onerror="alert('XSS Attack!')">
```

This script would execute when the todo is displayed.

**Prompt for Bob (Ask Mode):**

```
Explain the XSS vulnerability in the displayTodo() function.
Show me an example of a malicious payload and how it would execute.
```

**The Fix:**

Use `textContent` instead of `innerHTML`:
```javascript
function displayTodo(todo) {
    const todoElement = document.createElement('div');
    const title = document.createElement('h3');
    const description = document.createElement('p');
    
    // SECURE: textContent prevents script execution
    title.textContent = todo.title;
    description.textContent = todo.description;
    
    todoElement.appendChild(title);
    todoElement.appendChild(description);
    document.getElementById('todo-list').appendChild(todoElement);
}
```

### 3.3: Hardcoded Secrets Vulnerability

**Location**: `vulnerable-app/backend/config.py`

**Vulnerable Code:**
```python
# VULNERABLE: Hardcoded credentials
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://admin:SuperSecret123@localhost/todos"
API_KEY = "sk_live_abc123xyz789"
SECRET_KEY = "my-secret-key-12345"
```

**The Problem:**

- Credentials are visible in source code
- Anyone with code access has full system access
- Credentials can't be changed without code changes
- Different environments use same credentials

**Prompt for Bob (Ask Mode):**

```
Why are hardcoded secrets a security risk?
What are the best practices for managing secrets in applications?
```

**The Fix:**

Use environment variables:
```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

# SECURE: Load from environment
DATABASE_URL = os.getenv('DATABASE_URL')
API_KEY = os.getenv('API_KEY')
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')

# Validate that secrets are loaded
if not all([DATABASE_URL, API_KEY, SECRET_KEY]):
    raise ValueError("Missing required environment variables")
```

Create `.env` file (never commit this!):
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://admin:SuperSecret123@localhost/todos
API_KEY=sk_live_abc123xyz789
SECRET_KEY=my-secret-key-12345
```

### 3.4: Testing Vulnerabilities

**⚠️ WARNING**: Only test on your own systems!

**Test SQL Injection:**
```bash
# Try to inject SQL
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/todos/search?q=test'%20OR%20'1'='1"
```

**Test XSS:**
```bash
# Create todo with script
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/todos \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"<script>alert(\"XSS\")</script>","description":"test"}'
```

---

## Step 4: Implementing Fixes with Code Mode (10 minutes)

Now let's fix all the vulnerabilities using Bob's Code mode.

### 4.1: Switch to Code Mode

Change to **Code Mode** (💻).

### 4.2: Fix SQL Injection

**Prompt for Bob:**

```
Fix the SQL injection vulnerability in vulnerable-app/backend/app.py.
Replace the string formatting with parameterized queries using SQLAlchemy.
```

Bob should modify the `search_todos()` function to use safe queries.

### 4.3: Fix XSS Vulnerability

**Prompt for Bob:**

```
Fix the XSS vulnerability in vulnerable-app/frontend/app.js.
Replace innerHTML usage with safe DOM manipulation using textContent.
Update all functions that display user-generated content.
```

### 4.4: Fix Hardcoded Secrets

**Prompt for Bob:**

```
Fix the hardcoded secrets in vulnerable-app/backend/config.py.
1. Move secrets to environment variables
2. Create a .env.example file with placeholder values
3. Add python-dotenv to requirements.txt
4. Update the code to load from environment
```

### 4.5: Add Input Validation

**Prompt for Bob:**

```
Add input validation to the todo creation endpoint.
Validate:
- Title is required and not empty
- Title length is between 1 and 200 characters
- Description length is less than 1000 characters
Return appropriate error messages for invalid input.
```

### 4.6: Verify Fixes

**Important**: Bob has made the fixes directly to the files in `lab2/vulnerable-app/` (not in a separate solution folder). The vulnerable code has been replaced with secure code.

Run the application and test the fixes:

```bash
# Start backend (from the vulnerable-app directory where fixes were applied)
cd lab2/vulnerable-app/backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py # may conflict with AirPlay on the Mac, in which case run the following instead:
FLASK_RUN_PORT=8080 flask run

# Open frontend (from the vulnerable-app directory)
cd ../frontend
# Open index.html in browser
```

**Test Security:**
1. Try SQL injection - should fail safely (no data leaked)
2. Try XSS payload - should display as plain text (not execute)
3. Check no secrets in code (verify config.py uses environment variables)
4. Test input validation (try empty title, too long title, etc.)

**Compare Before/After:**
If you want to see the original vulnerable code, check the `lab2/solution/` directory which contains reference implementations of the fixes.
